# PythonAndCPP
This repository is for using Python and CPP together 

# Summarize the project 
This application takes an input file (input.txt) and user input to display the following:
a list of items and the number of times purchased, a specific item and the number of times 
it was purchased, and a histogram of all the items purchased. 

# Where could you enhance your code?  How would these improvements make your code more efficient? 
I'm not sure but I'd start with Python.  I think there could be some improvements to the calculations 
and the histogram.  After that I'd look into streamlining the CPP with more function definitions. 

# Did you find writing this code challenging? 
Yes I did.  Even with the starter cpp code from the resources, it was confusing at first to use
both languages.  I would scratch my head everytime my test output result was blank or weird at first. 

# How did you overcome the challenge?
The whiteboard is always the best.  Running the code manually and one at a time.  Always printing all 
output and dictionaries during testing phase. 

# What skills from this project are transferrable to other projects and/or course work?
The ability to use two languages to perform specific tasks will be paramount in all future projects and
course work.  This is what makes programs more efficient and developers more adept.
